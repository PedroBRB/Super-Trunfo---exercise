Super Trunfo (in C)
This project is a simplified version of the Super Trunfo card game, developed in C.
Each card represents a city or state with attributes like population, area, GDP, population density, and GDP per capita.
The program compares two cards based on one or two numeric attributes and determines the winner according to game rules.
It uses control structures such as if, else, switch, and loop constructs (for, while, do-while), with interactive menus and tie-handling logic.
The main goal is to practice conditional logic and control flow in C.
